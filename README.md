# bbgm-optimizers

Synergy optimizer and attribute table for BasketballGM/ZenGM games, created by @dumbmatter. trueOvr exports just about everything to an Excel file, the other one isn't as sophisticated (yet!). Prints out best possible permutations of lineup combinations, sorted by offensive/defensive/rebounding/total synergies.
